This site represents my skills **before attending Rithm School** My new site is currently in development.

Rithm School pre-work assignment:

[Description]

**1. Build a Personal Site**

To help solidify everything you’ve learned about HTML and CSS, we want you to build a personal website. Not only is this a great way to practice what you’ve learned, but it’s also going to be a great resource to have once you finish up the program and are starting to look for a job.

**Requirements**

At a minimum, your personal website should have the following:

Some sort of navigation (a navbar at the top of each page, for instance).
The following three sections, either as separate pages or as sections in a longer single page (depending on how you’d like to design your site):

* Landing Page
* About (including the ability to download a PDF of your most current resume)
* Contact

Styling! You can either use Bootstrap or write all of the CSS yourself, depending on what you want to practice.
The site must be deployed so that anyone can access it on the Internet.
**You do not need to add any JavaScript to your personal site** (though if you want to, go for it). If you do use JavaScript, use *vanilla JavaScript only* — no frameworks or third-party libraries (the goal of this project is really to consolidate your understanding of HTML and CSS.)

One suggestion: Look to the internet for inspiration. Before writing any code, search for personal sites that inspire you. Then, see how much you can build on your own using only HTML and CSS.
